# VinylSwipe

## Development

Install dependencies and run Netlify dev server to access serverless functions locally:

```bash
npm install
netlify dev
```

If you prefer running the Vite dev server directly, set `VITE_FUNCTIONS_BASE` to the URL of your Netlify functions (e.g. `http://localhost:8888`).
